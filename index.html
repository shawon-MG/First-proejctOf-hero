            <h1>Stay Focused on Mission <span class="dif-color">2022</span> </h1>
            <p>As a student of CSE final year I've waste lots of time doing nothing serious about my career. But, I've fixed my mind to one thing now which is learning web-development with the help of programming hero website. I fix this as a mission which I need to finish by june, 2022.</p><br>

            <h4>Mission</h4>
            <p>After a long time I've made a right decision which is taking the begineer-level course from Programming Hero website. As a final year student I need to attend my daily academic class also. Right now my major missions are getting selected for SCIC and getting a decent cgpa for my next semester exam. </p>

            <h4>Vission</h4>
            <p>As I know myself, software engineering job will be perfect for me. I see myself doing web-development job as a beginner. But, I've also interest in Data Science! So, after some time spending as a web-developer I maybe shift toward data-science releted work if everythig going well.</p>

            <h3>Develop <br> Without Limits</h3>
            <p class="p-pad">Software developers are a very special species. We often tend to avoid communication and when it comes to the public we would rather hide in the darkest corner of a room. So, it's to us to focus on our communication skills as much as we take serious action for technical skills.</p><br>
